### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Great job here, go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. Your HTML looks great. Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10004; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10004; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

I suggest adding some more detail to your wireframes. I'm not getting a clear idea of how your UI will be structured based on what I see here. More detailed wireframes will provide you with a much better guide when you start building out this project. Include details such as navigation links, buttons, text areas, headings, etc. Based upon your stated site goals outlined in Milestone 1, think about featuring projects you have worked on. Also, in your contact area, include a contact form. We'll be using php and Swiftmailer for that. 

Your HTML looks good. Don't forget to include alt text on your images though :)

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to start development on your PWP, but I strongly suggest refining your plan a bit more before starting to code.

### Milestone 2b Feedback
Nice work. Take a look at the notes we went over below, and check in with me or Skyler this week. After some cleanup you should be ready to deploy to ASO next week.

Your Milestone 2b passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Fix directory structure. Create an index.php file inside /public_html - this will be your home page. Create /lib directory for mailer.php, a /documentation directory to house your milestone documentation, /images directory, etc. 
- polish styling for a more professional presentation
- add additional content
- create a contact form

Set up ASO Host:

1. Go over https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/php/email/, add composer.json and mailer.php
2. enable shell access - chat live support and request them to enable this
3. Add your public SSH key (CPanel SSH Access)
4. Add an email account, and add an email forwarder if you like :)
5. Create a new deployment in PhpStorm that uploads to ASO, and upload your site there.
