### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10004; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10004; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

I suggest adding some more detail to your wireframes. I'm not getting a clear idea of how your UI will be structured based on what I see here. More detailed wireframes will provide you with a much better guide when you start building out this project. Include details such as navigation links, buttons, text areas, headings, etc. Based upon your stated site goals outlined in Milestone 1, think about featuring projects you have worked on. Also, in your contact area, include a contact form. We'll be using php and Swiftmailer for that. 

Your HTML looks good. Don't forget to include alt text on your images though :)

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to start development on your PWP, but I strongly suggest refining your plan a bit more before starting to code.
